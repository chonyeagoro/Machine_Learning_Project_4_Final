# Machine_Learning_Project_4_Final

## Overview
This dataset provides a detailed look at Market trends over five years (2019-2024), focusing on the price changes and trading volumes of various assets. It includes data on commodities like natural gas and crude oil, metals such as copper, platinum, silver, and gold, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and major stock indices and companies, including the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Berkshire Hathaway, Netflix, Amazon, and Meta Platforms. This dataset is a useful resource with valuable information that can be used to analyze global market trends and patterns.

## Goal of Project 
1. To analyze the historical stock price trends of Apple and Tesla between 2019-2024.
2. To investigate the correlation between trading volume and stock prices for Apple and Tesla.
3. To develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting prices of Apple and Tesla stocks using technical indicators such as moving averages.
4. To identify the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method in order to plot individual graphs of price vs volume.

## Challenges
- Trying to decide what visualizations that would best represent our data and findings.
- Trying to implement everything we have learnt especially with Machine Learning since itâ€™s a very detailed and complex branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
